# Top-Ups Stack: Sustain the Buzz

**Purpose:**  
This microstack is designed to **reignite** or **sustain** the Legal Buzz effects throughout the day — without overwhelming the system or triggering a crash.

## Components

| Compound       | Dose Range       | Role |
|----------------|------------------|------|
| **Phenethylamine (PEA)** | 100–250 mg | Rapid-acting stimulant; boosts dopamine/norepinephrine |
| **Hordenine**  | 10–25 mg         | MAO-B inhibitor; extends PEA effects, supports clean energy |
| **THC (microdose)** | 0.5–2 mg     | Optional modulator; enhances mood, creative flow, and comfort if carefully dosed |

---

## Protocol

```text
Use a top-up when:
- Focus fades
- Dopaminergic effects taper
- You need a second wind

**Dosing Window:** Every 3–5 hours, no more than 2 top-ups/day.

**Example Top-Up:**
- PEA: 200 mg
- Hordenine: 15 mg
- THC: 1 mg (optional, only if needed for calming synergy)
```

---

## Synergistic Effects

- **PEA + Hordenine** = Sharp lift in mood and motivation  
- **Microdose THC** adds creativity and subtle emotional fluency  
- **Avoid overstimulation** by capping top-ups and skipping if already anxious

---

## Important Notes

- Do **not** use with SSRIs or MAOIs  
- Avoid late-day dosing — it may interfere with sleep  
- Drink water, eat lightly, and **monitor mood** carefully

> When used wisely, top-ups can keep the Buzz *just right*.  
> When abused — it becomes a rollercoaster.
