# THC User's Note

**If you *must* add THC to the Legal Buzz stack...**

Please do so **sparingly.**

---

## Why?

THC is a **dominant neuromodulator** that:

- Over-amplifies GABA and anandamide systems  
- Suppresses dopamine and acetylcholine  
- In high doses, it can **knock out** the clarity and energy from the stack  
- Triggers **sleepiness, introspection, and sedation**, overriding stimulation

---

## Recommendation

- Use **minimal doses** (1–2 mg oral or 1–2 small inhaled hits)  
- Avoid high-THC edibles unless you're **intentionally seeking sleep**  
- Consider **CBD-dominant** strains if relaxation is the goal  
- Only add it **after** peak effects of the stack have passed

---

## Bottom Line

> THC can *erase* your Legal Buzz if you go too hard.  
> Respect the molecule — or it’ll tuck you into bed before your stack even starts singing.
