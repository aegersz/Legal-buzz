# Chaser Stack: Calm After the Storm

**Purpose:**  
To smooth out the comedown from stimulant or high-dopaminergic stacks while restoring neurotransmitter balance, cellular health, and inducing a serene, lightly dissociative, dreamlike state.

## Components & Effects

| Compound       | Role |
|----------------|------|
| **High-dose ALCAR** | Energizes mitochondria, clears residual metabolic byproducts, sharpens clarity |
| **NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine)** | Glutathione precursor, oxidative damage mitigator, neurocleanser |
| **Melatonin (3–10 mg)** | Encourages pineal DMT-like clarity, dream vividness, serotonin/dopamine reset |
| **Ashwagandha** | Adaptogen; reduces cortisol, calms the adrenals |
| **L-Theanine** | Increases GABA, reduces stimulant tension without sedation |
| **Choline (CDP or Alpha-GPC)** | Acetylcholine precursor; improves focus during transition phase |
| **Inositol** | Serotonin receptor modulator; mood stabilizer and anti-anxiety agent |

## Combined Effect

- **DMT-like clarity** from melatonin + NAC + ALCAR synergy  
- **Euphoric calm** from theanine + ashwagandha  
- **Neurotransmitter rebalance**: acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, GABA  
- **Smooth landing** with mild dissociation, meditative space, or restful sleep

## Warning

- Do not drive after taking this stack — drowsiness or dreamlike dissociation may occur.
- Effects may be amplified by prior stimulant use.
- Melatonin at high doses can cause vivid dreams or temporary emotional lability.
