# Dopaminergic Axis: Drive, Reward, Motivation

**Core Compounds:**
- **DLPA (DL-Phenylalanine)** â€“ Enhances both dopamine and endorphins.
- **L-Phenylalanine** â€“ Direct precursor to L-Tyrosine and downstream catecholamines.
- **L-Tyrosine** â€“ Converts to L-DOPA â†’ Dopamine â†’ Norepinephrine.
- **PEA (Phenethylamine)** â€“ Rapid stimulant, mimics dopamine surge.
- **Hordenine** â€“ MAO-B inhibitor that prolongs PEA activity.
- **ALCAR** â€“ Energizes neurons and enhances dopaminergic receptor sensitivity.

**Mechanism Summary:**
This axis fuels the motivation/reward system. PEA delivers a punch, while the others build baseline tone and longevity.
