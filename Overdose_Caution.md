# Overdose Caution: Legal Buzz Stack

**Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's harmless.**  
The Legal Buzz stack is potent and synergistic — pushing it too far can backfire.

## Signs of Overload or Overdose

- **Racing heart / palpitations**
- **Tremors or jaw clenching**
- **Insomnia lasting 24+ hours**
- **Panic or anxiety**
- **Paranoia or emotional flooding**
- **Gastrointestinal distress (nausea, cramping, or diarrhea)**
- **Mood swings or rebound depression**
- **"Crash" symptoms — fatigue, brain fog, irritability**

---

## High-Risk Combinations

- **Excessive PEA + Hordenine** → Risk of blood pressure spikes, anxiety
- **High Melatonin + Theanine + THC** → Extreme sedation or dissociation
- **Stacking multiple rounds** without breaks → Burnout and neurotransmitter depletion
- **Mixing with prescription meds** (e.g., SSRIs, MAOIs, antipsychotics) → Unpredictable interactions

---

## Safety Guidelines

- **Start low, escalate cautiously**
- **Hydrate well** and monitor your response
- **Don’t stack every day** — 5-on / 2-off max
- **Keep a mood/symptom log** to track tolerability
- **Stop immediately** if you feel overwhelmed, anxious, or unstable

## Emergency Tip

If you feel overstimulated or unsafe:

- **Take L-Theanine (200–400 mg)**  
- **Consume a small carb-heavy meal**  
- **Try deep breathing or light stretching**  
- **Avoid THC or alcohol as "counters" — they often worsen the rebound**

**Legal ≠ Risk-Free**  
Respect the molecules. Respect your limits.  
You're here to *enhance*, not *erase* yourself.
