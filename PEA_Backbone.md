# The PEA Backbone

**Phenethylamine (PEA)** is the molecular skeleton at the core of many stimulant and neuromodulatory compounds. Structurally, it consists of:

- A **benzene ring** (C6H5–)
- Attached to an **ethyl chain** (–CH2–CH2–)
- Ending in a **primary amine group** (–NH2)

**General formula:** `C6H5-CH2-CH2-NH2`

## Why It Matters

This simple structure is the foundational "backbone" for:

- **Phenylalanine** (adds a carboxyl group to the alpha carbon)
- **Amphetamine** (adds a methyl group to the alpha carbon)
- **Dopamine** (adds hydroxyl groups to the ring)
- **MDMA, Mescaline, and many nootropics** (variations of this core)

**PEA is to neuromodulators what carbon is to life** — versatile, essential, and endlessly modifiable.
