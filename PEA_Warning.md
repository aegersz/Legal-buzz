# PEA Laxative Warning

**Phenethylamine (PEA)** is not only rapidly metabolized by **MAO-B**, but also known to produce a **mild laxative effect** in some individuals, especially at higher doses (>400 mg).

---

## Why This Happens

PEA activates the **sympathetic nervous system**, which:
- Increases GI motility
- Stimulates peristalsis
- May induce a "flush" effect — especially if taken without food

---

## Tips to Minimize

- Start low (100–200 mg)
- Take with a small meal
- Pair with **Hordenine** (to reduce rapid onset)
- Stay hydrated

---

**Bottom line:**  
PEA is powerful — but your gut might not appreciate its enthusiasm. Respect the molecule.
