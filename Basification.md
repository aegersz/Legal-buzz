# Basification Strategy: Slowing Absorption for Smoother Effects

**Concept:**  
Using **sodium bicarbonate (bicarb of soda)** to **raise stomach pH**, slowing the breakdown and absorption of supplements and amino acids in the Legal Buzz stack.

---

## Why Do This?

When your stack hits **too fast**, you may experience:

- Jitters, anxiety, overstimulation  
- Rapid comedown  
- Gastrointestinal upset (PEA & tyrosine especially)

By basifying your stomach acid, you can:

- **Delay gastric emptying**
- **Slow conversion of amino acids into active forms**
- **Reduce PEA rush and prolong its window**

## How to Basify Safely

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **¼ to ½ tsp Sodium Bicarbonate** | Mixed in water, 10–15 min *before* your stack |
| **Alkaline Mineral Water** | Natural buffering effect, gentler but milder |
| **Low-Acid Meal (small)** | Oats, banana, light protein can slow absorption naturally |

---

## When to Use

- **First time trying the stack**
- **Known sensitivity to stimulants**
- **Trying to stretch effects across more hours**
- **Reducing GI discomfort from PEA or Hordenine**

---

## Cautions

- Don’t use bicarb with **acid-reducing medications** or **chronic GERD** without guidance  
- Too much bicarb may cause **bloating or diarrhea**  
- Avoid **daily use** to prevent electrolyte imbalance

**Pro Tip:**  
Want a smoother ride? Slow the rollercoaster at the gate.  
Basify. Delay. Glide.
